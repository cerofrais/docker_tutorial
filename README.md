# Docker tutorial for beginners
This is a tutorial on Docker for beginners who plan to use Docker in their development workflow.
This document is not for those who want to use it to deploy their applications in production.

For example, you are a student working on a course project, depending on some python libraries and are sharing a common computer with other students.
You want to keep your code and programming environment contained and do not want to effect the work of other students by installing libraries that may break their code. 
If so, then this document is for you.

**Disclaimer:**  
I made this guide while I was learning Docker myself.
If you find any errors point them out to me.

Head to the [wiki](https://github.sydney.edu.au/sdig7587/docker_tutorial/wiki/Docker-tutorial-for-beginners) for the rest of the tutorial.
